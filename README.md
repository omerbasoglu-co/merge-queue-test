# Sample repository

This repository demonstrates an integration between two different third-party CI services, `circleci` and `mergify`.

- `circleci` runs tests.
- `mergify` manages concurrent pull-requests.

## `circleci`

Configuration of this service is centralized in `.circleci/config.yml`.

## `mergify`

Integration is a work in progress.
